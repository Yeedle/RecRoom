A game or two (like chess or checkers) to be played with a friend over a network (or the Internet). 
This includes a client desktop app (made with JavaFX); a networking service (either WebSockets or a central server/web service); and the algorithms necessary for the actual games (making use of existing libraries, particularly if we will add the option of playing against a bot.)
